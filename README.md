**Weather Website**

Within this weather website, every person is provided with relevant weather information which updates in real time and is based on their location or a city that is entered. The site is constructed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and has a simple layout that is user friendly to look for current weather conditions.

---------------
Key Features:

**Location-based Weather**: It automatically fetches the weather based on the user's location by using geolocation.

**City Search**: Users can give any city name to view the details of the weather.

**Live Data**: The website has real-time data with latest weather information, including current conditions, temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit, humidity, wind speed, and a weather icon.

**Responsive Design**: The layout of the website is responsive to both mobile and desktop devices.

This project proves my skills in web development: creating an interactive, useful application with a modern design. It could be enhanced with further features, such as a 5-day forecast or even integration with a weather radar.
